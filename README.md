# Senior Capstone Program - Decryption/Encoding Tool
## Author: Michael Porter
## Year: 2024

### Overview
This Python program is designed to decode or encode text using various encryption and encoding methods. It offers the flexibility to choose from a range of decryption methods, including Caesar Cipher, Base64, Atbash Cipher, and ROT13 Cipher.

### Usage
To run the program:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the program is located.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
   - python decryption_tool.py
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the decryption method and input the ciphertext.
6. For some methods (e.g., Caesar Cipher), you may need to provide additional information such as the shift value.
7. The program will display the decoded plaintext.

### Available Ciphers
1. Caesar Cipher: Decrypts/Encrypts text encrypted using the Caesar Cipher method. Requires specifying the shift value used for encryption.
2. Base64: Decodes/Encrypts text encoded using the Base64 encoding method.
3. Atbash Cipher: Decrypts/Encrypts text encrypted using the Atbash Cipher method.
4. ROT13: Decrypts/Encrypts text encrypted using the ROT13 substitution cipher method.

Additional Notes
- The Base64 cipher supports both UTF-8 and ASCII character encodings. You can specify your choice when selecting the Base64 cipher in the program
- Feel free to customize or extend the program as needed to suit your requirements.

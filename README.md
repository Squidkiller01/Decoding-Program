# Senior Capstone Program - Decryption/Encoding Tool
## Author: Michael Porter
## Year: 2024

### Overview
This Python program is designed to decode or encode text using various encryption and encoding methods. It offers the flexibility to choose from a range of decryption methods, including Caesar Cipher, Base64, Atbash Cipher, ROT13, and Keyword Cipher.

### Usage
To run the program:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the program is located.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
   - python decryption_tool.py
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the decryption method and input the ciphertext.
6. For some methods (e.g., Caesar Cipher), you may need to provide additional information such as the shift value.
7. The program will display the decoded plaintext.

### Available Decryption Methods
1. Caesar Cipher: Decrypts text encrypted using the Caesar Cipher method. Requires specifying the shift value used for encryption.
2. Base64: Decodes text encoded using the Base64 encoding method.
3. Atbash Cipher: Decrypts text encrypted using the Atbash Cipher method.
4. ROT13: Decrypts text encrypted using the ROT13 substitution cipher method.
5. Keyword Cipher: Decrypts text encrypted using the Keyword Cipher method. Requires specifying the keyword used for encryption.

Additional Notes
- The program supports various character encodings, including UTF-8, ASCII, ISO-8859-1, and more. You can specify the character encoding method when decoding Base64-encoded text.
- Feel free to customize or extend the program as needed to suit your requirements.
